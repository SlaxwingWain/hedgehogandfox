# Unorganized

This is my best recollection of the ideas we came up with the first time we discussed it.

> The player begins as a hedgehog.<sup>1</sup> The grass is often taller than him, so it's very hard to see.<sup>2</sup> After a certain period of time, the hedgehog falls asleep, and the player now plays as a fox. The fox is obviously freer in movement and physical abilities. She's the heroine of the gameâ€”the hedgehog a mysterious aid. Although Hedgehog and Fox are in the same map, the difference in perspective (mainly their differing eye-level heights) helps us mask the fact that the fox is a number of years in the future.<sup>4</sup> Together, although unknowingly, they work together toward some end goal (which, we don't know yet).

> We talked about tracking "good" or "bad" actions by the characters (potentially guiding gameplay so whatever fox does, the hedgehog tends toward the opposite; but this kind of makes me sad...) so their meeting one day might be more dramatic.<sup>5</sup>

## What can Hedgehog do?

- Plant seeds (food or resources for Fox, later)
- Trigger geological events like rockslides or dams (probably with the aid of other animals, or... humans?)<sup>3</sup>

## New ideas not yet discussed:

 1. Should the hedgehog always (or at least at first) operate at night, since he's nocturnal? Maybe some silly item like "sunglasses" will allow him to operate in the day, later. The main draw to night though, is that it will help us trick the player into perceiving a continuous timeline, the hedgehog in the night, the fox in the day.
 1. To help the hedgehog "see," maybe some analog to a sense of smell, or mysterious "wisdom."
 1. What if there were humans in the game, usually disrupting the ecosystem and wreaking havoc; not to make it a game about environmentalism, but because humans are a more believable source for large, organized changes like building dams and bridges.
 1. What if the hedgehog is actually aging "faster" than the fox, so for example two consecutive nights for the hedgehog are actually 40 days apart, while fox's days really are contiguous. What this allows us to do is let the hedgehog and the fox meet one day. (Maybe the fox accidentally steps in hedgehog one day.) But already had another idea for a meeting: the fox could just meet the older hedgehog in its own timeline.
 1. One idea for drama is, the hedgehog beginning as a character that minds his own business and does what he can to help coordinate other animals with their problems. Little by little however, the hedgehog begins to view the humans as causing all these problems. The hedgehog grows into a Che-style revolutionist (because it's really cute to imagine this; that would definitely be the game poster, hedgehhog-Che), coordinating all the animals against the humans. Meanwhile, the fox begins as a character just looking for fun, driven mainly by curiosity. As humans appear, building their settlement, building bridges, etc. the fox likes to hang about and poke around. As the game progresses, the fox even approaches humans, who had seen the fox before and adores her. All the children love the fox especially, and the townspeople, even those who were wary at first, grow to treat Fox as a community pet. (This of course needs to happen far before Hedgehog even develops anything against humans. So we'll say Hedgehog develops opposition very late in the game. This means so far in the game as I've described, Fox is happy, Hedgehog is happy, and Fox is getting "lucky" finding yummy fruits, etc. that the Hedgehog plants.) Suppose the fox even saves a child in a landslide. Suppose the fox makes friends with dogs in the community (dogs who are loyal to their owners, and think the best of them). Suppose the humans and dogs fight off wolves trying to harm the fox. All these early-mid-game events must be designed to embed in the player's mind: Fox, good. Humans, friendly and good. Now we've set the scene for some drama. As Hedgehog mobilizes his forces at the end of the game, the scene cuts off, and... I'm not sure. Lots of things could happen here. Maybe we switch to a daytime hedgehog perspective, and the hedgehog looks scruffier, but the player think it's because it's daylight for the first time, when really, it's the same hedgehog, older, now in Fox's timeline! How should the "great battle" be depicted? What if we also did baby Fox... during the "war"... 
 
## Other ideas:

 - In a very subtle way, the story actually being from the perspective of birds! (Perhaps the only animals whose language we understand, besides Human.)

## Old ideas we may yet come back to:

- Continuous timeline. (Fox in the future seemed more interesting.)
- No dialogue. (This may be too limiting.)

## Andrew's thoughts after writing all this

I'm thinking about a major challenge we didn't consider before.

By having Fox's timeline a number of years in the future, I didn't realize we could cause time paradoxes if we're not careful. For example, if the hedgehog caused a landslide in his timeline, then that landslide should exist through _all_ of Fox's timeline! So we're forced to make the landslide a scripted event that the player _must_ cause. Alright, fine then, we say. But now say the hedgehog plants a seed somewhere. Why was the plant not there any other day?

I can think of two ways through this.

 1. **Who cares.** We make Time work back-to-the-future style. The landslide wasn't there for Fox yesterday, but it's there today. One advantage of this system is that it _really_ convinces the player that Fox and Hedgehog are in a continuous timeline, the _only_ strangeness being that plants seem to grow overnight.
 
 2. **Clever restrictions.** Imagine we prevented Fox and Hedgehog, for some "incubation" period, say, 30 cycles, from being able to access the same exact geographic areas. (Or at least, being able to *see* that they're in the same geographic areas.) Then when we "release" the Fox to be able to explore the intersecting areas, the "future" will have been set up, consistently. Similarly, we can use other events in the game can unlock where the Fox or Hedgehog can go; making it seem as if the storyline is simply guiding them, when really we're trying not to cause paradoxes.
 
 3. **Catch 22.** I suppose if we wanted to get real surrealistic, then we could make time non-contiguous (again, in clever ways as above, so it seems like it's part of the story / flashbacks) so Fox is also jumping around in his own timeline. This would be very difficult to do while still creating a followable, intuitive story. But even just thinking about it might generate some cool ideas.
